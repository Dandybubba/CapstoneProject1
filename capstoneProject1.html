        <p id="discription">
          Hello, my name is Delandis Marshon Massengill. I am 25 years old and
          live in Tennessee. Iâ€™m currently working full time for Trane
          Technologies as a braze assembler. I am married and currently looking
          to buy a home to call our own. I am also studying for my associates in
          business management while attending the Codex Academy to become a
          front-end developer. Some hobbies I have include drawing, playing
          guitar, and working out. I also like to go to sporting events such as
          watching the Tennessee Titans and the Nashville Predators.
